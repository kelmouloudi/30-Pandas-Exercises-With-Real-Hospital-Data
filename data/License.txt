About SyntheticMass:

SyntheticMass (syntheticmass.mitre.org) is a model of synthetic residents of the state of Massachusetts, with artificial health records for the fictional residents. This establishes a risk-free environment for:
- Data visualization
-Risk stratification
-Care management
-Clinical decision support
-Patient Reported data integration
-Evaluation of new treatment models
-Privacy and consent models
-Security and authorization models
-Third-party app development

SyntheticMass provides a sandbox for Health IT developers, researchers and clinicians interested in prototyping new healthcare solutions. It enables this through:
- Realistic data for fictional patients
- Data that is free of protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) constraints
- Datasets updated over time based on clinical healthcare models and epidemiological models of population health.
